            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a lightly oiled griddle to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Whisk almond flour, chocolate chips, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk egg, egg white, honey, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture, adding enough water to reach a pancake batter consistency.</li>
                <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the prepared griddle and cook until pancakes are golden brown and edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
