        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Melt 1/4 cup butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir salt and mustard powder into melted butter; remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Whisk milk and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; stir into butter mixture until well blended. Return saucepan to stove; cook milk mixture, stirring constantly, over medium heat until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat.</li>
                <li>Stir 3 cups Cheddar cheese into sauce until the heat from sauce melts cheese. Add pasta to cheese sauce and stir well; pour into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Combine remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese, gluten-free bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon butter, and paprika in a bowl; sprinkle over pasta mixture.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is crunchy, about 30 minutes.</li>
